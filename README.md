Real-time Go struct to JS object synchronisation over SSE and WebSockets

:warning: *This is beta software. Do not use this in production yet. Consider the API unstable. Please report any [issues](https://github.com/jpillora/velox) you encounter.*

### Features

* Simple API
* Synchronise any JSON marshallable struct
* Delta updates using [JSONPatch (RFC6902)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)
* Supports [Server-Sent Events (EventSource)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) and [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
* [Server-Sent Events (EventSource)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) client-side poly-fill to fallback to long-polling in older browsers.

### Quick Usage

Server

``` go
//syncable struct
type Foo struct {
	velox.State
	A, B int
}
foo := &Foo{}
//serve velox.js client library (assets/dist/velox.min.js)
http.Handle("/velox.js", velox.JS)
//serve velox sync endpoint for foo
http.Handle("/sync", velox.SyncHandler(foo))
//make changes
foo.A = 42
foo.B = 21
//push to client
foo.Update()
```

Client

``` js
// load script /velox.js
var foo = {};
var v = velox.sse("/sync", foo); //choose either: velox.sse() or velox.ws()
v.onupdate = function() {
	//foo.A === 42 and foo.B === 21
};
```

### Example

See this [simple `example/`](example/) and view it running live here https://velox.jpillora.com.

*Note: CloudFlare is in front of this page so it uses [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) instead of [WS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)*

### Notes

* JS object properties beginning with `$` will be ignored to play nice with Angular.
* JS object with an `$apply` function will automatically be called on each update to play nice with Angular.
* `velox.SyncHandler` is just a small wrapper around `velox.Sync`:

	```go
	func SyncHandler(gostruct interface{}) http.Handler {
		return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			if conn, err := Sync(gostruct, w, r); err == nil {
				conn.Wait()
			}
		})
	}
	```

### Known issues

* Object synchronization is currently one way (server to client) only.
* Object diff has not been optimized. It is a simple property-by-property comparison.
	* :warning: a proper performance test has not been done yet.

<!--
### Improvements

* Use deflate in [the client](https://github.com/dankogai/js-deflate) and on [the server](https://golang.org/pkg/compress/flate/) for more byte savings.
